Donations accumulate until they reach enough to support a week of full
time work. Once they get to this amount, a week will be scheduled. The
amount of time each project receives is planned based on the amount of
donations received that specify that project in the drop-down.

If one project receives a million dollars and another project receives
one dollar, at least an hour will be spent on the second project.
